-------------------------- [folder socket-client-server]-------------------------------------

    This is a simple example server and a client where server will open a socket 
    and wait for clients to connect. Once client is connected he can send a message 
    and server will process the message and reply back the same message but converted 
    into upper case to demonstrate the server side processing and transmission.

    In the folder there are two files.py:
      · server.py
      · client.py
